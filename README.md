# Three features of my Course Registration project here:
* Course Management
* Student can not add multiple item in course list
* My project has a latest feature that can measure and calculate the course credit, credit hour and total cost. A student can not get more than 20 credit if it exist student can take a alert.

# How can I manage my state in this project.
* Firsty i can declare a state in app.jsx file cause we can share props from parent to child. and also declare a envent handler function for handle the event. App.jsx send a props to his child component and the button we clicked it can get the handle function then the onclick connect with that and if we click the button then a parameter is send to the app.jsx file event handler function and the function update the state valu. In this way I manage my state in this project.
